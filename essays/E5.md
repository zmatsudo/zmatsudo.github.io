# Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details.

# What did you learn from this assignment?
The main thing that I learned from this assignment was how to create validations for logins and signups. When sigining up I was able to restrict what characters a person could have in their emails and passwords. With the passwords I was also able to make some requirements such as the password needed one number and a speacial character or else the server would not let the user through. The last thing I learned about validation was how to create a length requirement for the full name and password section. 

# Did you work with a partner?
I did not work with a partner. 

# How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
When I needed help or encountered a problem I usually looked it up online, looked at the labs, asked a classmate or asked the professor. I needed help figuring out how to create the code to validate the signup information. I usually looked it up online to see how I should format the code since we did not learn this in class. Another thing I needed help with was that I had a permissions error popping up when running my website on the class server. I had to get help from the professor for this one and it got fixed. 

# How was developing this asignment different than assignment 1?


# Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code, (c) testing and debugging.
I spent about 10% thinking about how to do something, 40% writing code and 50% testing and debugging. I usually do not spend too much time thinking abnout how to do something and go straight into writing code based off what I already know and learned. So maybe I should spend more time thinking and see if it helps me with assignment 3. I spent majority of my time writing code, testing and debugging. I took a lot of time testing to see if the code worked correctly and also did a lot of checks like checking I used the correct variables and  making sure I had the {} brackets lining up in my if statements. 

# Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?


# If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
If I could go back I would start assignment 2 earlier than I did. I was exhausted from assignment 1 so I took a break and started assignment 2 a little later than I wanted too. There was 2 weeks until assignment 2 was due but I probably did not start until less than a week left so that really hurt since.
