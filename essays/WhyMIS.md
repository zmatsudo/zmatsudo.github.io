I decided to major in MIS because I have always been interested in technology and computers. I also believe that technology will continue to improve and be used more in the workplace as well as everyday life. By learning more about these information systems it will give me the tools I need to be successful in the future. I also want to learn how to code because it will be a very useful skill in the future.
