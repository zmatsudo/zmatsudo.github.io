# My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways
I have imporved in making loops to pull the product information from my JSON or js file and display it on my HTML page. 

# I need to work on the following to imporve my programming skills
I need to work on creating functions since this gave me the most problems when completing assignment 1. 

# I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast
I have learned a lot from the WODs which have helped me when completing Assignment 1. I have been able to complete the Invoice 1-3, Smartphone 1-3 and Store1 without watching the screencasts, but it did take me a lot longer to complete and required more attempts. The algorithm WODs like making change and day of the week were very difficult for me to complete on my own, so I had to ask for the screencasts for these WODs. After watching the screencasts and completing these two WODs I now have a better understanding for algorithms but I am not as confident with this aspect of coding compared to the rest of the things I learned. 

# The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence
The labs are very helpful as I am able to learn new concepts and test them out in vs code. I am able to watch how the professor uses the code and also can see how to fix any errors that show up. Looking in the console for errors is one of the most helpful things that I have learned in the labs since the console says what is wrong and even includes what line the problem is on. The on your own section of the labs can be confusing sometimes since I am usually just learning about new concepts in class. I am able to complete the labs but I would not say with confidence, more like I can complete them but there are still some things I may not understand. 

# I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2


# I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways
I think something that can help my learning is if the labs moved a little bit slower during class. When doing the labs it can be at a very fast pace which does not give me enough time to copy the code and understand what it does. 


# What helps me the most in class are
What helps me the most in class is the assignment workshops because I am able to work on my assignment in class and if I have a question then I can ask the professor right there instead of having to send an email or wait for office hours. This allows for quicker responses and it means I can solve problems faster and move on to the next steps in the assignment.
